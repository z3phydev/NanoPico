# Total Time Spent - About 23 Hours

## 1/26/2026 - Finished the Schematic - About 6 Hours  

_Time spent: 6.0h_  

Using the offical "Hardware Design with RP2040" as a reference alongside other RP2040 development board schematics. I ended up with a fairly simple custom board.

## 1/27/2026 - Made 2 Versions (USB A Male and USB C Female) ~ 8 Hours  

_Time spent: 8.0h_  

I made 2 PCBs, one USB A version and one USB C. The usb a schematic is slightly updated as seem below.

The USB A version PCB is 14mm x 15mm and the total footprint is 14mm x 30.3mm ![Screenshot 2026-01-27 185258](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6OTMxNTgsInB1ciI6ImJsb2JfaWQifX0=--5352ed71423d9697b99bb9062d271ad9f72f390f/Screenshot%202026-01-27%20185258.png)

The USB C version PCB is 14mm x 16mm whereas the total footprint is just larger at 14mm x 16.8mm

## 1/31/2026 - Finished the USB A PCB - Around 6 Hours  

_Time spent: 6.0h_  

Its like playing 3D chess. I used soo many vias and micro vias. I had to slightly increase the PCB size to 16mm x 15mm and now the overall footprint is 31.5mm x 15mm which is still really small. ![image](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6OTU2MjYsInB1ciI6ImJsb2JfaWQifX0=--0a2f8b223082570391486a2db23ab46651e71571/image.png)

I have since decided this is the only one I'll focus on  

## 2/1/2026 - Created BOM - About 2 Hours  

_Time spent: 2.0h_  

In hindsite I proboally should have choosen the componenets before making the PCB but all is fine since im using fairly common parts. I will be using JLC Assembly so the BOM is a bit funnky. ![image](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6OTYzNzEsInB1ciI6ImJsb2JfaWQifX0=--ded186af3b8697b323c0a2d9edbe126149fd19c9/image.png)

## 2/1/2026 5 PM - Finished Repo - About an Hour  

_Time spent: 1.0h_  

Made a Repo and made it look nice. Don't look ot close at the commits...  After looking at the prices PCBway might be cheaper but I'm just waiting for a quote. I was going to use jlc but it cost way too much in assembly cost (And I don't think I could do such precise SMD work)![image](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6OTY1MTcsInB1ciI6ImJsb2JfaWQifX0=--bb8db3de0f0d36e321a122d091d395c054463f01/image.png)
